Crown Clothing 

This is a concept clothing store built using React, with a Firestore database for users and items. Redux is used for state management regarding the user's login session and theri cart items. It is simplistic in it's design and is more useful as an exploration of component based architecure and state management. Some interesting integrations include Google OAuth sign in and the Stripe Payments API on checkout (this is just on the front-end though, no payments are actually facilitated).
